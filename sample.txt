I am a BTech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with a strong interest in full-stack development.
I enjoy building clean, responsive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I am continuously improving my problem-solving and programming skills through hands-on projects.
I have experience collaborating on academic and hackathon projects.
My goal is to secure a role in a product-based company and grow as a skilled software engineer.
